# Steps to finish prototype

### merging projects
- [X] configure GPIO pins for LoRa
- [X] configure SPI on Raspberry Pi

    [link to the issue](https://github.com/mayeranalytics/pySX127x/issues/21) - Comment by Mike Routen made on Dec 5, 2018

    Enable SPI on Interface Options
    ```console
        sudo raspi-config
    ```

    1. "dtoverlay=spi0-cs,cs0_pin=25" at the end of `/boot/config.txt`
    2. clone the repo [pySX127x](https://github.com/mayeranalytics/pySX127x)
    3. Follow installation process
    4. Change the values described on the github Issue in SX127x/board_config
    5. Add the respective lines found on the github Issue to SX127x/constants.py
    6. Add the respective lines found on the github Issue to SX127x/LoRa.py
    7. Try and run sudo ./lora_util.py
        1. Assertion Error: Try and reboot the raspberry

### Steps to finish prototype
- [ ] Figure out how to integrate LoRa Communication and P4Pi OS
    - probably using a dummy interface to receive and send packet from and to LoRa
- [ ] Rebuild sniffer script with scappy
- [ ] Rebuild sendp function to send packets to dummy interface

## Project Decisions

- [ ] Not implementing DHCP server on local network for brevity
