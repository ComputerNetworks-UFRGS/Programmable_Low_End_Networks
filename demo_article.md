# IntLowEnd: an off-the-shelf Prototype for Programmable Low-End Networks

## Abstract

* programmability as focus on high end network
* unlocking LPWAN technologies
* interoperability
* architecture and prototype
* off-the-shelf hardware
* lessons from the prototype
* low power, low cost, long range

## Introduction

* PDP, vendor-unlocked, switches
* PDP for high-end, not observed in low-end (LPWANS)
* tradeoffs, inovative use-cases, provide internet for marginalized populations (15-17)
* “can we devise programmable LPWAN devices that retain features like low cost and long range that make them popular?”
* specific applications and services
* conflict of objectives between LPWAN and PDP research
* convergence between LPWAN and PDP.
* experimented its potential by means of emulation
