## Welcome Note 

Selected photos taken during the experimentation of our prototype for our submission to NOMS_Demo_Session 2025 - 38th IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium - Demo Session.

**Demo paper title:** Bringing Programmable Low-End Networks to Life: A Field Study with An Off-the-Shelf Prototype 

**Abstract:** _This demo session paper presents a simple and affordable prototype that could open the doors to mitigate digital segregation in technologically marginalized populations. Converging software-defined networks (SDN) with programmable data planes (PDP), our approach allows the customization of low-cost hardware according to the network designed. We integrate low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), known for their scalability and efficiency, with PDPs to propose a flexible solution for changing requirements, such as distance and terrain configurations, validated through real-world test scenarios._
